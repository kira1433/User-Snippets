\subsubsection{Binomial Properties}\\

Recurrence formula:\\
$\binom n k = \binom {n-1} {k-1} + \binom {n-1} k$\\
Symmetry rule:\\
$\binom n k = \binom n {n-k}$\\
Factoring in:\\
$\binom n k = \frac n k \binom {n-1} {k-1}$\\
Sum over k:\\
$\sum_{k = 0}^n \binom n k = 2 ^ n$\\
Sum over n:\\
$\sum_{m = 0}^n \binom m k = \binom {n + 1} {k + 1}$\\
Sum over n and k:\\
$\sum_{k = 0}^m  \binom {n + k} k = \binom {n + m + 1} m$\\
Sum of the squares:\\
${\binom n 0}^2 + {\binom n 1}^2 + \cdots + {\binom n n}^2 = \binom {2n} n$\\
Weighted sum:\\
$1 \binom n 1 + 2 \binom n 2 + \cdots + n \binom n n = n 2^{n-1}$\\
Connection with the Fibonacci numbers:\\
$\binom n 0 + \binom {n-1} 1 + \cdots + \binom {n-k} k + \cdots + \binom 0 n = F_{n+1}$\\

\subsubsection{Catalan Numbers}\\
Number of correct bracket sequence consisting of $n$ opening and $n$ closing brackets.
The number of ways to connect the $2n$ points on a circle to form $n$ disjoint chords.
The number of non-isomorphic full binary trees with $n$ internal nodes (i.e. nodes having at least one son).
$C_n = \frac{1}{n + 1} {\binom{2n}{n}}$

\subsubsection{Stars and bars}\\
The number of ways to put $n$ identical objects into $k$ labeled boxes is
$\binom{n + k - 1}{n}$
(Try to think of it as stars and bars $\bigstar | \bigstar \bigstar |~| \bigstar \bigstar$)


\subsubsection{Labelled Graph with k-connected components}\\
Sum for all K:
$G_n = 2^{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}$
k = 1:
$C_n = G_n - \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} k \binom{n}{k} C_k G_{n-k}$
For any k:
$D[n][k] = \sum_{s=1}^{n} \binom{n-1}{s-1} C_s D[n-s][k-1]$
